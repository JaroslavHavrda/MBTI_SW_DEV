# Introduction
The agile software development is still unsettled topic in 2022. While ideas behind the agile development have proven itself in many occasions, we have seen it fail. There are many co called agile transformations that do not result in desired improvement. While symptoms of failed agile transformations are generally well known and ways out are pioneered, there remains one important question to be answered: "Why do software developers so often end up with Zombie Scrum?"

My theory that I want to explore here is: Being a good software engineer requires different brain functions than being good at agile software development.

# Jungian cognitive functions
I will use the notion of [Jungian Cognitive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_cognitive_functions).

Jung uses four cognitive functions:
- Thinking
- Sensing
- Feeling
- Intuition

Each cognitive function can be introverted and extroverted.                                                                                             
Each person has different mix of cognitive functions. You may have some cognitive functions well developed and some other neglected so much you can not really use them.

Descriptions here are based on the book 
[Nejsou stejné by Šárka Miková](https://www.cbdb.cz/kniha-229778-nejsou-stejne).

## Thinking

You are using your thinking function whenever you process information or manipulate axioms.

You are using *extroverted thinking* if you classify or sort objects. When using extroverted thinking you are interested mainly in exterior properties of objects,
not that much about how things work. You may want to create taxonomies or classifications.

If you use *introverted thinking*, you tend to do a deep introspection of objects. You are analysing how things work. You may have some set of axioms and create a theory from them, or you may have
an object and try to create a theory about it, but constructing and validating a theory will be in the centre of you mind.

## Sensing

Sensing function allows you to gather sensations, observe the world and get new information.

You use *extroverted sensing* when you sense the world here and now. Extroverted sensing is what gets you all what is happening without any censorship. The sensing cognitive function does not
try to interpret or categorize what you see, just gets you the information. And since the function is extroverted, it does not control the focus and just pieces you everything.

You use *introverted sensing* when we use memories of what we saw or lived through. Introverted sensing will compare an situation with situation that you lived before, find a closest match
and give you answers, that were valid last time. If you are in a new situation, your introverted sensing may try to fabricate answers for you based on your believes

## Feeling

Feeling functions are responsible for your beliefs and inner motivations.

You use *extroverted feeling* when you try to align yourself with the group you are in. With extroverted feeling you try to define group goals and achieve them as a group.
You try hard to guess other people's problems and solve them as your own. Last but not least you care for group harmony.

You use *introverted feeling* when you try to uphold your beliefs or your moral integrity. Introverted feeling may try tr project your feelings into others.

## Intuition

The intuition cognitive function is related to seeing patterns and connections.

You use *extroverted intuition* when you try to match old patterns with new possibilities. Extroverted
intuition will make you exploring new possibilities, new spaces. You break status quo and bring new views. With extroverted intuition you bring new ideas, although you may not care enough to push those ideas forward.

You use *introverted intuition* if you create your unique view of things. Introverted intuition creates symbols, creates new interpretations of information and events. If you use introverted in tuition you may picture a whole scenery in your mind based on a few fragments. 

# What cognitive function is useful in software development?

## Technical excellency

### Seniority level
The whole idea of seniority level is based on the idea of using introverted sensing. The more experience
you have in some field the more can introverted sensing kick in and navigate you directly to the
correct place. Provided of course that the field did not change.

### Problem solving
Problem solving is a domain of introverted thinking. The capability of creating theories about a problem will allow you to create a working hypothesis, use this hypothesis to create a plan and then execute the plan to to resolve the problem. Provided you had correct information when you formulated the theory.

### Gathering real world data
Extroverted sensing is good in gathering real world data about a problem. This will be helpful since it ensures that the problem we solve is the correct one.

## Reflection of agile manifesto

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
The focus on individuals and interactions is a nod to extroverted feeling with its capability to manage and align group goals and care for good of the group.

### Working software over comprehensive documentation
I do not see any cognitive function preferred here, this is more of goal statement. All cognitive functions above can work towards this goal.

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Again the required focus on customers brings extroverted feeling to my mind. This time I would emphasize owning other people's problems.

### Responding to change over following a plan
I would argue that for responding to change you could use extroverted intuition with its inflow of ideas, connections and patterns.

# So how can using cognitive functions that are good for software development hurt your agility?

As you probably noted, the overlap between cognitive functions required for agility and for being a good SW developer is rather small. So what are risks that we have to overcome?

With introverted sensing we have to overcome a big momentum of developers past experiences. While we want to change his or her way of working, his brain may automatically fall back to old ways of working. We need to care for the fact that the simple act of doing things differently may inflict stress on him or her.

With introverted thinking we are tempted to do a big upfront plan. Developer with introverted thinking may also tend to apply mechanically some framework. Pre made plan is still plan after all.

# Possible reconciliation

## Is agile software development wrong?
No it is not. Agile software development is not only winning chaos report, it is behind a big turnaround in Microsoft. Spotify is viewed as a role model company by many others. However please note that there are risks connected with it. If you do not have people with skills to support agile values, or those people do not have the power to uphold those values, you will end up with cargo cult agile and your development will be hurt.

## Have T-shaped people?
Well if you can... Being T-shaped in terms of cognitive functions can help. It can help to you in personal life too. But being T-shaped in terms of cognitive functions can be a hard task. Training a new cognitive function will is in order of years and the result is not guaranteed (at best). That why I would not consider it as a guideline.

## Hire for diversity?
This is a good option in bigger teams. You still need to consider the size of your team and think about technical skills you need. And you need to keep in mind that the more boxes you have to tick the bigger teem you need to accommodate all the people you need to hire. Strictly ticking your boxes in this case may bring you to the situation where you need to hire a woman COBOL developer with introverted sensing and there may be no such developer in the market. On the contrary it may be a good idea to reserve one place in the team for hire by personality. vIf you want to go this path, you can consider
[Belbin team roles](https://www.belbin.com/about/belbin-team-roles).

## Create team structure and processes with psychology in mind!
The collaboration between people using different cognitive functions may be very stressful. Imagine for example a person using extroverted intuition collaborating with a person using introverted sensing. While the first is constantly coming with new ideas, the other is rooting to tried solutions and has problems with the constant change the extroverted intuition is proposing. If you have both of them in one team, you will need to provide platform for them so that new ideas are coming in sustainable pace for the introverted sensing person to accommodate, but there is still enough influx of new ideas so that the extroverted intuition person is not frustrated with lack of change.
