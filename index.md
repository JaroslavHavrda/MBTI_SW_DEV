# Introduction

I will use the notion of [Jungian Cognitive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_cognitive_functions).

Jung uses four cognitive functions:
- Thinking
- Sensing
- Feeling
- Intuition

Each cognitive function can be introverted and extroverted.                                                                                                    

## Thinking

You are using your thinking function whenever you process information or manipulate axioms.

You are using *extroverted thinking* if you clasify or sort objects. When using extroverted thinking you are interested mainly in exterior properties of objects,
not that much about how things work. You may want to create taxonomies or classifications.

If you use *introverted thinking*, you tend to do a deep introspection of objects. You are analyzing how things work. You may have some set of axioms and create a theory from them, or you may have
an object and try to create a theory about it, but constructing and validating a theory will be in the center of you mind.

## Sensing

Sensing function allows you to gather sensations, observe the world and get new information.

You use *extroverted sensing* when you sense the world here and now. Extroverted sensing is what gets you all what is happenning without any censorship. The sensing cognitive function does not
try to interpret or categorize what you see, just gets you the information. And since the function is extroverted, it does not control the focus and just gices you everything.

You use *introverted sensing* when we use memories of what we saw or lived through. Introverted sensing will compare an situation with situation that you lived before, find a closest match
and give you answers, that were valid last time. If you are inb a new situation, your introverted sensing may try to fabricate answers for you based on your believes

## Feeling

Feeling functions are responsible for your beliefs and inner motivations.

You use *extroverted feeling* when you try to align yourself with the group you are in. With extroverted feeling you try to define group goals and achieve them as a group.
You try hard to guess other peopple's problems and solve them as your own. Last but not least you care for group harmony.

You use *introverted feeling* when you try to uphold your beliefs or your moral integrity. Introverted feeling may try tr project your feelings into others.
