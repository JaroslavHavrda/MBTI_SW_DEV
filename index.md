# Introduction

I will use the notion of [Jungian Cognitive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_cognitive_functions).

Jung uses four cognitive functions:
- Thinking
- Sensing
- Feeling
- Intuition

Each cognitive function can be introverted and extroverted.                                                                                                    

## Thinking

You are using your thinking function whenever you process information or manipulate axioms.

You are using *extroverted thinking* if you clasify or sort objects. When using extroverted thinking you are interested mainly in exterior properties of objects,
not that much about how things work. You may want to create taxonomies or classifications.

If you use *introverted thinking*, you tend to do a deep introspection of objects. You are analyzing how things work. You may have some set of axioms and create a theory from them, or you may have
an object and try to create a theory about it, but constructing and validating a theory will be in the center of you mind.

## Sensing

Sensing function allows you to gather sensations, observe the world and get new information.

You use *extroverted sensing* when you sense the world here and now. Extroverted sensing is what gets you all what is happenning without any censorship. The sensing cognitive function does not
try to interpret or categorize what you see, just gets you the information. And since the function is extroverted, it does not control the focus and just gices you everything.

You use *introverted sensing* when we use memories of what we saw or lived through. Introverted sensing will compare an situation with situation that you lived before, find a closest match
and give you answers, that were valid last time. If you are in a new situation, your introverted sensing may try to fabricate answers for you based on your believes

## Feeling

Feeling functions are responsible for your beliefs and inner motivations.

You use *extroverted feeling* when you try to align yourself with the group you are in. With extroverted feeling you try to define group goals and achieve them as a group.
You try hard to guess other peopple's problems and solve them as your own. Last but not least you care for group harmony.

You use *introverted feeling* when you try to uphold your beliefs or your moral integrity. Introverted feeling may try tr project your feelings into others.

## Intuition

The intuition cognitive function is related to seing patterns and connections.

You use *extroverted intuition* when you try to match old patterns with new possibilities. Extroverted
intuition will make you exploring new possibilities, new spaces. You break status quo and bring new views. With extroverted intuition you bring new ideas, altough you may not care enough to push those ideas forward.

You use *introverted intuition* if you create your unique view of things. Introverted intuition creates symbols, creates new interpretations of information and events. If you use introverted in tuition you may picture a whole scenery in your mind based on a few fragments. 

# What cognitive function is useful in software development?

## Classical career advice

### Seniority level
The whole idea of seniority level is based on the idea of using introverted sensing. The more experience
you have in some field the more can introverted sensing kick in and navigate you directly to the
correct place. Provided of course that the field did not change.

### Problemsolving
Problemsolving is a domain of introverted thinking. The capability of creating theories about a problem will allow you to create a working hypothesis, use this hypothesis to create a plan and then execute the plan to to resolve the problem. Provided you had correct information when you fromulated the theory.

## Reflection of agile manifesto

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
The focus on individuals and interactions is a nod to extroverted feeling with its capability to manage and align group goals and care for good of the group.

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Again the required focus on customers brings extroverted feeling to my mind. This time I would emphasize owning other peoples problems.

### Responding to change over following a plan
I would argue that for responding to change you could use extroverted intuition with its inflow of ideas, connections and patterns.
